# R-Seminar-Assign-Topics
A simple R script to fairly assign topics and dates to students in a seminar

# Purpose
This script is originally used to assign dates and topics for a seminar in which students have to hold a presentation about some topic at some date, and topics are not linked to dates. 
Simply let the students insert their preferred dates and topics in "SelectedTopics.csv" and this script will try to find a solution that 
suits most students. 
I'm sure there are better optimization algorithms if you need to find "the" best solution, but this script's results seem ok to me.
